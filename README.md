OpenBCI-AndroidApp
==================
This Android application demonstrates the capability of interfacing an RFduino with an Android app to store processed data (as comma separated values) received from the RFduino onto a file on the file system.

This work is based on the work done by Lann Martin found here: https://github.com/lann/RFDuinoTest 

Description
=================
MainActivity: the main activity class for the Android app

SaveBytesToFile: an AsyncTask to store processed data onto a file

RFduinoService: Android service to connect, display data, and display GATT services and characteristics supported by the RFduino via the Android BLE API

OpenBCIDataConversion: helper class to convert byte data received from RFduino into microvolt values

FormatDataForFile: helper class to convert the process data into comma separated values

BluetoothHelper: RFduino specific Bluetooth computation

HexAsciiHelper: helper class to convert bytes to hex/ASCII values

Usage
=====
-Turn on the Bluetooth using the “Enable Bluetooth" button

-Press “Scan” to begin a BLE scan for GATT servers on devices

-When an RFduino is found, some of the device information will be displayed under “Device Info”

-Press “Connect” to connect to the RFduino

-You can either type in your command using the text input provided or press “Start” to send a “b” (begin) command to the RFduino

-Click “Stop” to send a “s” (stop) command to the RFduino

-Press “View File” to open the data file for the current session and use your favorite text viewer to view the “.csv” file

Note: All files are stored under an “OpenBCI” folder in the file system. The files are name “openbci<timestamp>” where the time stamp is in the "yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss" format.
